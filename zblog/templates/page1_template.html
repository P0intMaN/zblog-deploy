                <p>
                    A good blog has a nice introductory para. It is meant to capture
                    the attention of the readers. HTML has been curated just for these
                    purposes, although many people undersee it. In this post, I will 
                    walk you through how to write a proper blog with HTML and Bootstrap 
                    classes. Remember, to give your user an awesome experience, you must
                    invest some time styling your blogs. 
                </p>

                <!-- a blog post is divided into multiple sections, each having a title -->
                <div class="parent-section py-3">
                    <!-- section title -->
                    <h2 class="fw-bold">I am a title</h2>

                    <p>
                        A blog post is divided into multiple sections, each having a title.
                        Just now, I created a sample title. Usually or I should say very 
                        frequently, a blog post contains multiple paras. You can do that
                        by wrapping your contents in <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag. I am
                        demonstrating this below for your convenience.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Okay, so I am the second paragraph. Now paragraphs are great! But
                        sometimes you can't explain a particular concept in a single para.
                        Therefore, we create a sub-section inside the parent section. Let's
                        go ahead and do that.
                    </p>

                    <!-- A sub-section inside parent-section -->
                    <div class="sub-section pt-3">
                        <!-- sub-title -->
                        <h3>I am a sub-title</h3>
                        
                        <p>
                            This is a paragraph meant to explain a particular concept.
                            Now that you are familiar with the basic format of writing a blog,
                            let's go ahead and look at the formatting options.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="parent-section py-3">
                    <h2 class="fw-bold">Formatting the blog</h2>

                    <p>
                        We will keep using the above mentioned hierarchy to write the blogs.
                        Okay, using bootstrap helps us a lot. Notice how the above paras were
                        so dull and monotonic. That's because we never introduced text-styling.
                        This section will cover some necessary formatting options.
                    </p>

                            something with super emphasis, make sure to display them with a different 
                            background color. Like below:

                            Let's go ahead and add an image. Note that you can add images
                            of any size. I've made it completely responsive and will be 
                            viewed across any devices without any problem. <strong>Just

                            The control is completely upto you. You can go ahead and experiment
                            with awesome color combinations and perhaps develop your own
